=======================

Why a static-generated website?
- I'm not a web developer - wanted to separate my content from the presentation.
- Makes it really easy to change the look and feel of my website - without
  breaking RSS.
- I'm security major. Spent way to much time in college learning about all
  the nasty things you can do to a website with a database.

Why Pelican when GitHub natively support Jekyll?
- Gave me the opportunity to play with a Python tool.
- Everyone else does Jekyll.
